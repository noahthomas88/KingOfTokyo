King Of Tokyo Definition of Done:

By John Gear, Noah Thomas, Joshua Warning, Fisher Shen

Game Set-Up:
There may be 2 to 6 players.
Each player will have 10 health, 0 victory points, 0 energy, and 0 power cards.
If there are 5 to 6 players then there are 3 places on the board: outside Tokyo, Tokyo city, and Tokyo bay.
If there are currently 2 to 4 players There are only 2 places on the board, Tokyo City, and outside of Tokyo.
Three power cards are revealed from the deck.
Each player rolls the six dice and whoever has the most attacks on their role is first and when there are multiple players have most attacks, repeat the process. The game progresses clockwise around the “table” from that point.

Dice Mechanics
The game begins with 6 dice for each player to roll
Each die has 6 sides, with faces that are (1,2, or 3 attack), energy, and health.
If a player has a special power card they permanently roll with one additional die. These cards can be stacked for a stronger effect. However there are only 3 cards that allow this which leads to a max of 9 dice to roll
Players have the option to re-roll selected dice 2 additional times.
The numbers add victory points to the player, if you roll 3 of a kind of either 1, 2 or 3 the player gains as many victory points as the number that was duplicated 3 times. Any additional numbers of the same face add 1 more victory point to the player.
For each attack face that is rolled, players outside of the current players location will lose one health point.
For each heal face that is rolled, the player gains one health point. (Health cannot exceed 10 points)
For each energy face that is rolled, the player gains one energy point.
Once a players turn is over, they will pass the dice to the next player

Tokyo City/Tokyo Bay Rules:
If no one is in Tokyo City, a player must enter Tokyo City. This includes the first turn of the game. The same is true for Tokyo Bay if there are more than 5 players
A player earns 1 victory point when they enter Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay
If a player starts their turn in Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay then they gain 2 victory points
Players in Tokyo City or Tokyo Bay cannot heal from dice rolls.
You can only leave Tokyo after losing health from another player. If you choose to do so, that player must take the position.
Once the game has 4 or fewer players, the player who occupies Tokyo Bay must move out. If Tokyo City is empty, the player must move there.

End of Turn:
Resolve any power up cards that activate on the end of the turn
Pass the “turn” to the next player

Power Up Cards
Energy points can be spent to purchase any of the three face up cards and the face up card will be replaced with one from the deck after purchase.
A player can choose to spend 2 energy points to “sweep” the three visible cards off of the board and reveal three new power cards. 
Power cards have three different properties, either they will take effect immediately after purchase, they will be kept by a player and will cause a permanent change, or they are kept by a player until the conditions of the card have been met and then discarded.

When a player reaches 0 health:
When a player reaches 0 health they lose. The only exception to this rule is if a player possesses the power card that gives them an extra life.
If a player reaches 0 health and 20 victory points at the same time they still lose, unless they have the power card that gives them an extra life.
All cards and energy points are discarded.

End of Game:
When a player accrues 20 victory points and health is not zero, They win
When only one player is the only player left alive, They win
If all players die at the same time every player loses
